I'm Prakash Ramesh. I'm all about tech and building systems that scale and stand the test of time. I've spent a good chunk of my career working on things like Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), cloud tech, and designing distributed systems that actually work in the real world.

Originally from Chennai, India, I've spent most of my professional life in the US, working with big enterprises and awesome teams. I've helped design tech solutions for everything from cloud deployments to containerization and performance scaling. I'm the kind of person who loves diving into the details to make sure everything runs smoothlyâ€”and I've gotten pretty good at it!

Lately, I'm really into AI Ops, observability, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). I've even coached teams on Chaos Engineering and led initiatives to make systems more reliable and self-healing. It's a fun challenge, and I'm all about keeping things running smoothly at scale.

When I'm not geeking out over tech, you'll find me hiking, traveling, or trying to snap a good photo. If you're in the Bay Area, you'll probably catch me on a trail somewhere.
