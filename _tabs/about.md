I'm a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for building cool, scalable systems and helping organizations grow through innovation. I’ve spent a lot of time in the tech trenches, especially in areas like Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), cloud technologies, and building large, distributed systems that actually work in the real world.

Over the years, I’ve worked with some amazing teams to design and architect tech solutions that tackle everything from cloud deployment to containerization and performance scaling. I love diving into the details and figuring out how to make things run smoothly—and I’ve gotten pretty good at it!

I’m also super into AI Ops, observability, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). In fact, I’ve had the chance to coach teams on Chaos Engineering and lead efforts to make systems more reliable and self-healing. It’s a challenge I love, and it’s all about keeping things up and running at scale.

I’ve had the chance to work across a ton of different industries—like manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and even human experience management (SAP-HXM). I’ve also gotten deep into integration platforms like Salesforce and MuleSoft, so if you’re into that kind of stuff, we’re probably on the same page!

Oh, and I’m a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), and an Adobe Certified Expert (ACE). Basically, I’m always trying to level up my skills and stay ahead of the curve.

On this blog, I share my thoughts on all things tech—from cloud-native architectures to AI Ops, SRE, and whatever else is keeping me busy. I hope you’ll find something useful, and feel free to drop me a message if you want to chat about tech or just geek out over the latest trends. Let’s learn and grow together!

Thanks for stopping by!
